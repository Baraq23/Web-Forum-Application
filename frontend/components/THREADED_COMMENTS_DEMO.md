# Threaded Comments Implementation Demo

## 🧵 How Threaded Comments Work

The forum now supports **full threaded comments** where users can:
1. **Comment on posts** (top-level comments)
2. **Reply to comments** (nested replies)
3. **Reply to replies** (multi-level threading)

## 📋 Step-by-Step User Flow

### **Scenario 1: Commenting on a Post**
```
1. User sees a post
2. Clicks on comment button or scrolls to comment section
3. Types in the comment box: "Great post!"
4. Clicks "Comment" button
5. Comment appears as a top-level comment
```

### **Scenario 2: Replying to a Comment**
```
1. User sees an existing comment: "Great post!"
2. Clicks the reply button (💬) on that comment
3. A reply form appears showing:
   - "Replying to [username]"
   - The original comment preview
   - A text box: "Write your reply to @username..."
4. User types: "I agree completely!"
5. Clicks "Reply" button
6. Reply appears indented under the original comment
```

### **Scenario 3: Replying to a Reply (Multi-level)**
```
1. User sees a reply: "I agree completely!"
2. Clicks the reply button on that reply
3. Reply form appears for the nested comment
4. User types: "Same here, very insightful!"
5. Reply appears indented under the previous reply
```

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### **Comment Structure**
```javascript
// Top-level comment
{
  id: 1,
  content: "Great post!",
  username: "alice",
  Replies: [
    {
      id: 2,
      content: "I agree completely!",
      username: "bob",
      parent_comment_id: 1
    },
    {
      id: 3,
      content: "Same here, very insightful!",
      username: "charlie",
      parent_comment_id: 1
    }
  ]
}
```

### **Visual Hierarchy**
```
